### Practice & homework
The practice for this week takes place in notebooks. Just open them and follow instructions from there.
* __Seminar:__ `./seminar.ipynb`
* __Homework:__ `./homework.ipynb`

Unless explicitly said otherwise, all subsequent weeks follow the same pattern (notebook with instructions).

### More materials (optional)
* Video lectures from Stanford CS224N - [__intro__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ), [__embeddings__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERibwqs9p38) (english)
